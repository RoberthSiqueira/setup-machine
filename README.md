# Setup machine by myself

The project contains steps for configuring a new machine. My motivation was an upgrade by the company that I am. Some situations make sense like a new job and a new personal machine.

## First Initialization
Choose Brazilian Keyboard, NOT ABNT

## OS
Update to the last macOS acceptable

### Setup Display
Set time to Display off and Screen Saver
Setup Touch Id

### Configure Hot Corners
Bottom Left: Mission Control 
Bottom Right: Lauchpad
